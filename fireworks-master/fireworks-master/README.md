More details as the code is developed.

Requirements from the Moodle handout (not formatted in MD)

CS370 Computer Graphics – Final Project
This is a group project; choose your groups and your projects. Each group should have 3-4 members. A number of suggestions are given below. You are welcome to propose other ideas. If you would like to propose your own idea, you must discuss it with me no later than Nov 18.You may not undertake any of these (including the ones I suggest below) without getting my approval. You must settle on a topic and get my approval no later thanNov 21 (Monday).

Objective: Putting it all together. Impressing your friends, family, possibly yourself and, not incidentally, the instructor.

Requirements:
- The scale must be sufficiently complex to merit working on it for 3 weeks but not so complex that it is not realistically possible to complete in that period. In keeping with this, it will be helpful if the project offers a variety of ways of scaling back, of simplifying, in case it proves to be overly ambitious or unforeseen complications arise.
- If you would like to propose your own idea, make sure that your projects produce an interactive application. Moreover, the interaction should actually exercise some abstract thought. Whatever you do it needs to be something more than wallpaper.

Anyone of these must be fully developed with a reasonably easy-to-use interface, well integrated into the window system.
Final Submission: Dec 11 (a single tar file including the following)
1. Executable file.

2. Well-structured and well-documented source code.

3. A project report.pdf file:
1) How to use the running code and how to build it from the source?
2) Design of the project.
3) Structure of the source files,
4) What have been finished, what have not been finished, and your future 5) State group members’ responsibilities and efforts in the project.

4. A PPT that you used in your demo meeting.


Demo Meeting: Dec 8 13:00-14:20PM

1. Give a group presentation for your project, explaining what you have done in
this project (the design, structure of your project). Each one should give a short presentation of what they have done in this project.

2. Demo: show how to play with your project.
You are required to explain the structure of your project (use a PPT) and demo it during the demo meeting. You should come ready to explain how it works at that time. This will also be a component of your grade.
