# About

Code in here comes from the link on Moodle:

http://r3dux.org/2010/10/how-to-create-a-simple-fireworks-effect-in-opengl-and-sdl/

Not sure how we'll adapt it and I haven't tested it yet, but this is a good base case to learn from.

Files:
* firework.{h,cpp}: the firework class
* fireworks_sdl.cpp: fireworks code that uses an SDL file
* fireworks_sdl_copy.cpp: I think the same as the previous file but downloaded separately
* fireworks_no_sdl.cpp: fireworks code with no SDL, more implementation in that file

Worth revising those descriptions but it's a start.
